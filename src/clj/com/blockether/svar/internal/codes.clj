  "Fenced code-block extraction from raw LLM text responses.

   Pure parsing. No HTTP, no provider knowledge. Used by `ask-code!` to turn
   a plain-text completion into a vector of tagged code blocks the caller
   reads/evals directly.

   Extraction rules — `extract-code-blocks` recognizes three shapes:
     1. Tagged fence:        ```clojure\\n…\\n```   →  {:lang \"clojure\" :source …}
     2. Untagged fence:      ```\\n…\\n```          →  {:lang nil       :source …}
     3. No fence at all:     entire response          →  {:lang nil       :source …}

   `select-blocks` then enforces strict lang matching: ONLY blocks whose
   `:lang` equals the caller-supplied target survive. Untagged blocks
   (`:lang nil`) — including the fenceless-fallback case — are DROPPED.
   Models that want their code accepted MUST tag their fence with the
   requested lang."

   `:source` is the body verbatim (newlines preserved; no trim applied to
   internal whitespace).

   Lenient+ fallback: when `raw` contains NO fenced block at all, returns
   one block `{:lang nil :source <trimmed-raw>}`. Empty / blank input
   returns `[]`.

   `ask-code!` callers do not.

   If the entire trimmed reply is wrapped in ONE outer code fence
   (```lang …``` or ``` …```), that single wrapper is stripped so the fence
   markers don't leak into the source. Any other shape (no fence, or
   interior fences) is used VERBATIM — we never split a reply into multiple
   blocks here.

   Returns `{:lang <lang> :source <code>}`, or `nil` when the reply is

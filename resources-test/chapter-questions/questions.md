## Questions

### Q1 [evaluate / inferential]

**Question:** What is the relationship between unmet emotional needs and early maladaptive schemas (EMS)?

**Answer:** Early maladaptive schemas (EMS) are thought to arise from unmet emotional needs. For instance, EMS within the Disconnection and Rejection domain, such as Abandonment or Emotional Deprivation, are more closely correlated with each other than with EMS from other domains, like Entitlement.

**Evidence:**
> If early maladaptive schemas (EMS) arise from a core set of unmet emotional needs, the EMS proposed to result from a common unmet need should correlate more highly together than EMS from different domains (related to different unmet needs)… The EMS thought to arise from disrupted and deprived attachments within the Disconnection and Rejection domain – Abandonment, Emotional Deprivation, Social Isolation, Mistrust/Abuse, and Defectiveness/Shame – should correlate more closely with each other than those thought to arise from deprivation of limit setting: Entitlement/Grandiosity and Insufficient Self-Control/Self-Discipline.

### Q3 [apply / procedural]

**Question:** What were the study methods and findings of schema therapy for eating disorders in a group setting?

**Answer:** The study involved eight women with mixed eating disorders undergoing two-hour sessions focused on mode conceptualization and mode-based treatment. There was a 43% reduction in EMS severity post-treatment and 59% reduction by six months, with significant improvements in anxiety and eating disorder symptoms among completers.

**Evidence:**
> An uncontrolled study of an adapted form of SCBT-g for a group of eight women with mixed eating disorders (75% Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) was conducted by Simpson, Morrow, van Vreeswijk, and Reid [72]. Sessions were lengthened to two hours and focused on a mode conceptualisation and mode-based treatment focus of eating behaviour and negative body image. Although two dropped out, the remaining six members achieved a 43% reduction in EMS severity post-treatment and a 59% reduction by 6-month follow-up. Four of the completers achieved clinically significant change in EMS activation, anxiety and depression symptoms, and eating disorder symptoms.

### Q4 [apply / procedural]

**Question:** What was the outcome of using videoconferencing in schema therapy for eating disorders?

**Answer:** In a case report involving seven video appointments over 11 weeks, a 39-year-old woman experienced a 77% improvement in eating disorder symptoms along with abstinence from vomiting and improved self-esteem and psychopathology.

**Evidence:**
> In a case report, Simpson and Slowey [74] described a brief mode formulation-informed therapy delivered via videoconferencing for a 39-year-old woman with Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified characterised by a 15-year history of yo-yo dieting and daily self-induced vomiting. Following one telephone and seven video appointments over 11 weeks, she achieved a 77% improvement in eating disorder symptoms, 28 days abstinence from vomiting, and improvements in general psychopathology, distress, and self-esteem.

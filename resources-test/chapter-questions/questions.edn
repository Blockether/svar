{:questions [{:question "What is the relationship between unmet emotional needs and early maladaptive schemas (EMS)?", :answer "Early maladaptive schemas (EMS) are thought to arise from unmet emotional needs. For instance, EMS within the Disconnection and Rejection domain, such as Abandonment or Emotional Deprivation, are more closely correlated with each other than with EMS from other domains, like Entitlement.", :evidence-span "If early maladaptive schemas (EMS) arise from a core set of unmet emotional needs, the EMS proposed to result from a common unmet need should correlate more highly together than EMS from different domains (related to different unmet needs)… The EMS thought to arise from disrupted and deprived attachments within the Disconnection and Rejection domain – Abandonment, Emotional Deprivation, Social Isolation, Mistrust/Abuse, and Defectiveness/Shame – should correlate more closely with each other than those thought to arise from deprivation of limit setting: Entitlement/Grandiosity and Insufficient Self-Control/Self-Discipline.", :source-document "7c49e4cb-8b8c-4f79-a4d2-75074b68071d", :source-page 0, :source-section "Evidence that Schemas Result from Unmet Needs", :difficulty :evaluate, :category :inferential} {:question "What study explored short-term group schema therapy for mixed personality disorders?", :answer "The study titled 'Short-term group schema therapy for mixed personality disorders: A pilot study' was conducted by Skewes, Samson, Simpson, and van Vreeswijk, and was published in Frontiers in Psychology in 2015.", :evidence-span "Skewes S, Samson R, Simpson S, van Vreeswijk M.
